# TDD-Battleships
This version was written based upon Test Driven Design methodology.

## Compiling

Once the .js files have been compiled, the program can be run with the command `node .\battleships.js` and the program will prompt an entry.

## Running tests
The test folder contains a set of jest tests. To run these, first jest must be installed in the root folder, this can be done with the command `npm install jest`. Once jest is installed, the tests will be executed by the command `npm run test`
